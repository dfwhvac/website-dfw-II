NOTES
-----

1. All service pages use "Template A" - comprehensive service layout with:
   - Hero section
   - What We Do
   - Our Process
   - Why Choose Us
   - Pricing tiers
   - FAQs
   - Testimonials

2. Company pages use "Template B" - flexible content layout

3. Content is managed through Sanity CMS at /studio

4. Pages marked "Not Built" are linked in the footer navigation
   and should be created before site launch


================================================================================

FUTURE TASKS
------------

DESIGN & CONTENT (PHASE 1 - COMPLETE)
   [x] Testimonial Carousel - Homepage carousel with 12 reviews, auto-scroll, navigation
   [x] Reviews Page - Full list with pagination, "Load More" button
   [x] Dynamic Colors - Brand colors editable via Sanity
   [x] Header/Footer Sanity Controls - Navigation, taglines, links editable
   [x] Commercial page links fixed
   [x] Navigation dropdown alignment
   [x] "Home" removed from desktop nav (kept in mobile)
   [ ] "View All Services" Button - Redesign or repurpose (currently links to 404)
       Note: Button exists on homepage but /services page won't exist;
       Consider: two buttons (Residential/Commercial) or scroll anchor
   [ ] Lead capture form backend - Email notifications when form submitted
       Note: Requires email service decision (Resend recommended)
   [ ] Bulk Testimonial Import - Import 50 reviews via Sanity (user to provide export)
       Note: Google only allows 5 reviews via API; user needs to export reviews
       manually from Google Business Profile or use third-party tool
   [ ] Test Carousel - Verify carousel behavior with full 50 reviews dataset
   [ ] Complete remaining footer pages (Case Studies, Financing, Cities, FAQ, etc.)

URL & STRUCTURE CLEANUP
   [ ] Clean URLs - Remove "/services/" prefix from URL structure
       Current:  /services/residential/air-conditioning
       Cleaner:  /residential/air-conditioning
       Note: Low priority cosmetic change; requires route refactoring,
       Sanity slug updates, redirects if pages already indexed
       Effort: ~1-2 hours

MARKETING & ANALYTICS (After design finalized)
   [ ] Facebook Pixel integration
   [ ] Google Analytics 4 / Traffic Tracking
       Note: Similar to Facebook Pixel; implements GA4 and optionally
       Google Tag Manager for managing multiple tracking scripts
   [ ] Advanced SEO (sitemap.xml, schema markup)

PERFORMANCE (After colors finalized)
   [ ] Convert dynamic Sanity colors to static Tailwind
       Note: See DYNAMIC_COLORS_GUIDE.md for step-by-step instructions

OTHER
   [ ] Custom domain setup
   [ ] Lead capture form backend (email notifications)
   [ ] Service visibility toggle - Add "published" field to service schema
       Note: Allows hiding services via Sanity without deleting content;
       Useful for temporary removal or seasonal adjustments

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS
   [ ] Seasonal Homepage Strategy - Dynamic content based on season
       Context: HVAC traffic is temperature-driven. Visitors arrive with
       specific intent (AC broken in summer, heater broken in winter).
       Showing "all services" may dilute conversion.
       
       Options to evaluate:
       a) Auto-detect season → Feature cooling (Apr-Sep) or heating (Oct-Mar)
       b) Sanity toggle → Manually switch "featured season" in CMS
       c) Geo-weather API → Show services based on local temperature
       d) A/B test → Measure conversion: all services vs. seasonal focus
       
       Implementation considerations:
       - Hero messaging: "AC Emergency?" vs "Heater Not Working?"
       - Featured services section: Show 2-3 relevant services, not all
       - CTAs: Season-specific calls to action
       - Could maintain year-round services in nav, but homepage focuses
       
       Priority: Post-launch optimization based on traffic data
