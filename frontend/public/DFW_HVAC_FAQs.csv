"How long do HVAC systems typically last?","With proper maintenance, air conditioning systems typically last 15-20 years, while furnaces can last 20-25 years. Heat pumps average 15-18 years. Factors affecting lifespan include maintenance frequency, usage patterns, and local climate conditions.","residential-equipment"
"What size HVAC system do I need for my home?","System sizing depends on your home's square footage, insulation, window placement, ceiling height, and other factors. An undersized system won't cool effectively; an oversized one cycles too frequently. We perform a detailed load calculation to recommend the right size for your home.","residential-equipment"
"What is a SEER rating and why does it matter?","SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) measures an air conditioner's cooling efficiency. Higher SEER ratings mean greater efficiency and lower energy bills. Current minimum standards require 14-15 SEER, while high-efficiency units reach 20+ SEER. Higher efficiency units cost more upfront but save money over time.","residential-equipment"
"Should I repair or replace my old HVAC system?","Consider replacement if your system is 15+ years old, requires frequent repairs, uses R-22 refrigerant (phased out), or your energy bills are increasing. Generally, if a repair costs more than 50% of a new system's value, replacement is the better investment.","residential-equipment"
"How often should I have my HVAC system serviced?","We recommend professional maintenance twice per year - once in spring for your AC before summer, and once in fall for your heating system before winter. Regular maintenance prevents breakdowns, extends equipment life, maintains efficiency, and keeps warranties valid.","residential-maintenance"
"How often should I change my air filter?","Standard 1-inch filters should be changed every 30-60 days. Higher-quality 4-inch filters can last 3-6 months. Factors like pets, allergies, and home dustiness may require more frequent changes. A dirty filter restricts airflow, reduces efficiency, and can damage your system.","residential-maintenance"

"How much does a new AC unit cost?","The cost of a new AC system varies based on the size of your home, system efficiency rating (SEER), brand, and any additional work needed. Residential systems typically range from $4,500 to $12,000+ installed. We provide detailed quotes after assessing your specific needs.","residential-pricing"
