## Original Problem Statement

Build a premium, conversion-focused website for DFW HVAC using Next.js frontend and Sanity.io CMS. The site serves as a lead funnel for the HVAC business, featuring service pages, city pages, reviews, and lead capture forms.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15.5.9 (App Router) + React 19.2.5 deployed on Vercel
- **CMS:** Sanity.io (headless CMS)
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (leads collection)
- **Email:** Resend API (lead notifications)
- **Domain:** dfwhvac.com (GoDaddy DNS → Vercel)
- **APIs:** Google Maps/Places, Google reCAPTCHA v3, RealWork widget

## Key Milestones

- **Site launched (Wix → Next.js):** April 16, 2026 (confirmed via Let's Encrypt SSL cert issue date `notBefore=Apr 16, 2026 20:04:44 GMT`)
- **Next.js 14 → 15.5.9 + React 19 upgrade deployed:** April 20, 2026
- **GSC Domain property added:** February 20, 2026 (pre-launch; data before Apr 16 reflects the old Wix site)

## What's Been Implemented

### Session: April 20, 2026 (continued) — Python backend deletion (P2.17 completed)
- **Deleted `/app/backend/` entirely** — 374-line FastAPI server + `requirements.txt` + `.env` + `.gitignore`. Verified 100% dead: zero frontend references, no cron/CI/Docker calling it, all functionality already in Next.js API routes.
- **Preserved the integration test** — `git mv backend/tests/test_dfw_hvac.py → frontend/tests/test_dfw_hvac.py` (history preserved). This test covers the Next.js API despite its original Python location.
- **Post-deletion verification:** `yarn build` ✓ 30s clean, no regressions. Codebase is now single-stack (Next.js only).
- **Benefits:** ~400 lines of dead code removed, Python dependency burden eliminated (no more FastAPI/Motor/Pydantic CVE alerts), cleaner repo, no more Python complexity noise in future code reviews.

### Session: April 20, 2026 (continued) — Code Review Response
- **Applied (legitimate fixes):**
  - `components/SchemaMarkup.jsx` — added `safeJsonLd()` helper that escapes `<` to `\u003c` before injection. Prevents theoretical `</script>` breakout from CMS-sourced strings. All 3 JSON-LD sites (`LocalBusinessSchema`, `FAQSchema`, `ReviewSchema`) use the helper. JSON-LD still parses correctly across home, /about, city pages, /services (verified via curl, 0 literal `</script>` in any rendered schema).
  - `backend/tests/test_dfw_hvac.py` — converted `assert body.get("success") is True` → truthy check `assert body.get("success")`. The reviewer's suggested `== True` is itself flagged by ruff as E712 anti-pattern; truthy check is the Pythonic fix.
- **Declined (false positives / wrong fixes):**
  - `<script>{JSON.stringify(data)}</script>` alternative — React escapes JSX children, which would BREAK schema markup (invalid JSON-LD, Google can't parse)
  - DOMPurify — wrong tool (for HTML, not JSON)
  - React state setters in hook dep arrays — `useState` setters are guaranteed stable by contract; adding them is noise
  - Module constants (`DFW_LAT`, `REALWORK_ID`, etc.) in hook deps — they never change; adding them is noise
  - WebAPI globals (`IntersectionObserver`, `sessionStorage`) in hook deps — not deps per React rules
  - Refs (`containerRef`) in hook deps — per React docs, refs shouldn't be in dep arrays
  - Mass index-as-key rewrites for static non-reorderable lists — no actual bug
  - ColorProvider `hex`/`root` "missing" deps — `root` is local to the effect, `hex` is property access on `colors` which IS in deps
- **Added to backlog (legitimate but needs thoughtful work, not drive-by fixes):**
  - **P2.15** Oversized component decomposition (ServiceTemplate 450L, CompanyPageTemplate 406L, HomePage 378L, CityPage 318L) → 8–12 hrs
  - **P2.16** `/api/leads` POST refactor (complexity 23 → <10 via extracted validators) → 3–4 hrs
  - **P2.17** Python backend decommission decision (`/app/backend/server.py` is NOT called by Next.js — legacy from Wix migration)
  - **P2.18** Index-as-key audit — classify 44 instances as safe-static vs. stateful-needs-fixing → 2 hrs

### Session: April 20, 2026 (continued) — TBT Optimization (PR #1 of 2 for performance sprint)
- **Scope:** Lazy-load 3 third-party scripts (Maps, reCAPTCHA, RealWork). GA4 already on `afterInteractive` — left as-is per user decision.
- **Fixes:**
  1. **Google Maps / Places** (`components/AddressAutocomplete.jsx`): Removed mount-time `useEffect` eager load. Added `onFocus` handler — Maps script only loads when user actually focuses the address input. Bounced visitors who never touch the form save ~800–1,200ms of TBT. Also added inline "Powered by Google" attribution (with official brand colors on each letter) that appears when the field gains focus, to comply with Google Places API terms throughout the interaction (not just when the suggestions dropdown renders its own branding).
  2. **reCAPTCHA v3**: Removed from root layout (`app/layout.js`). Extracted into new `components/RecaptchaScript.jsx` component using `next/script strategy="lazyOnload"`. Included inside `LeadForm.jsx` and `SimpleContactForm.jsx`. Pages without forms (/reviews, /faq, /cities-served list, 27 city detail pages, /services list, /privacy, /terms, /recent-projects) no longer load reCAPTCHA at all. Pages with forms defer until page is interactive.
  3. **RealWork widget** (`components/RealWorkWidget.jsx`): Added IntersectionObserver with 200px rootMargin. Widget's 3rd-party script only loads when container enters viewport. Users who bounce from /recent-projects before scrolling save ~200–400ms.
- **Verified:** `yarn build` clean (40s), lint clean, Playwright smoke test across 13 representative pages confirmed reCAPTCHA + Maps load patterns match spec. 27 city detail pages + /reviews + /faq + /cities-served + /services + /privacy + /terms + /recent-projects all load 0 recaptcha + 0 maps requests now.
- **Expected production TBT improvement:** Pre-fix baseline ~2,300ms. Expected post-fix ~500–800ms (measurable via Lighthouse + GSC Core Web Vitals report after 28d field data). Perf score 69 → 85+.

### Session: April 20, 2026 (continued) — P1.1 City Meta Descriptions (Path A implementation)
- **Discovery:** All 28 city pages had `metaDescription: null` in Sanity (including Denton). The "Denton gold template" and all other city descriptions were coming from a single code fallback in `app/cities-served/[slug]/page.jsx` line 64. The original P1.1 plan (populate 27 Sanity CMS records) would have been 27× more work than necessary.
- **Implementation:** Added `buildCityMetaDescription(cityName, zipCodes)` helper above `generateMetadata` in the same file. Uses an adaptive zip-line format (1 → "Zip: X.", 2 → "Zips: X, Y.", 3 → "Zips: X, Y, Z.", 4+ → "Zips: X, Y, Z & more."). Fallback signature: `city.metaDescription || buildCityMetaDescription(...)` — still allows per-city Sanity override.
- **New template:** `[City], TX AC & heating repair, install & maintenance. Same-day service. Call (972) 777-2665. Licensed, family-owned. [Zip line].`
  - Front-loads city + primary keyword (stronger SERP match than "Professional heating and air conditioning services in...")
  - Adds phone CTA with dialable digits (enables Google SERP click-to-call on mobile)
  - Adds trust signals ("Licensed, family-owned") — absent from old template
  - Adaptive zip line → per-page hyper-local variation, no "Zip: " empty tail
- **Verified:** `yarn build` ✓ (no regressions, 36s clean build). `next start` + curl confirmed 12 sampled cities (spanning all 4 zip-count variants) render correctly. All 28 descriptions now fit within 128–158 chars (below 160-char SERP desktop truncation; CTA visible on mobile).
- **Also drafted:** All 27 city descriptions populated in columns E + F of `/app/frontend/internal/DFW_HVAC_Site_Audit.xlsx` for audit reference (though Path A obviates the need to paste them anywhere — they're generated by the function).

### Session: April 20, 2026 (continued) — Click-to-Call Bug Fix
- **Root cause:** `companyInfo.phone` in Sanity stores the vanity format `(972) 777-COOL`. Two pages (`/services`, `/cities-served`) and the LocalBusiness schema (`SchemaMarkup.jsx` x2, `lib/metadata.js`) used this value directly in `tel:` hrefs. Mobile browsers cannot dial letters — every tap on "Call Now" was a dead-end conversion since site launch Apr 16.
- **Fix (Option B — clean architecture, single source of truth):**
  - Repurposed existing `phoneDisplay` Sanity field (already populated with `(972) 777-2665`) as the canonical dialable value
  - Updated 5 call sites to use `companyInfo.phoneDisplay || '+1-972-777-2665'` fallback
  - Improved Sanity schema field descriptions so future editors know which field goes where (vanity text vs. tel: hrefs)
  - Hardcoded E.164 format in `lib/metadata.js` JSON-LD telephone field for schema parser compatibility
- **Verified:** `yarn build` passes (no regressions, all 11 static pages + dynamic routes compile). Local `next start` + curl confirms:
  - `/services` + `/cities-served` "Call Now" hrefs now render `tel:(972) 777-2665` ✓
  - LocalBusiness schema `telephone` now renders `(972) 777-2665` ✓
  - 22 hardcoded `tel:+19727772665` links across Header/Footer/etc. unchanged (were already correct)
- **Impact:** Restores mobile click-to-call conversion on two of the highest-intent landing pages. Ready for merge to main → Vercel auto-deploy.

### Session: April 19, 2026 — Next.js 14 → 15 Upgrade
- Upgraded `next` 14.2.35 → **15.5.5**, `react` 18.2.0 → **19.2.5**, `react-dom` 18.2.0 → **19.2.5**, `eslint-config-next` 14 → **15.5.15**
- Verified all dynamic route pages already use the Next 15 `await params` async pattern — no code changes needed
- Removed extraneous lockfiles (`/app/frontend/package-lock.json`, empty `/app/yarn.lock`) that confused Next.js workspace detection
- `yarn build` passes with no errors; all 11 static pages + dynamic routes compile successfully
- **Testing (testing_agent_v3_fork iteration_1):** 26/26 pytest cases pass; all critical flows verified end-to-end
  - All 14 page routes HTTP 200 (home, about, contact, services, service detail, cities-served, city detail, reviews, faq, estimate, request-service, recent-projects, privacy, terms)
  - `/api/leads` validation (400), happy-path (200 + MongoDB persistence), rate-limit (5/15min enforced), HTML sanitization — all pass
  - `/api/cron/sync-reviews` auth (401 without Bearer, proceeds with CRON_SECRET)
  - Lead forms on /contact, /request-service, /estimate submit successfully end-to-end
  - All 6 legacy redirects (301) still work (/scheduleservicecall, /installation, /iaq, /ducting, /seasonalmaintenance, /testresults)
  - Security headers intact (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
  - **Zero React 19 hydration warnings, zero page errors, zero visual regressions** vs baseline screenshots
- Pytest regression suite created at `/app/backend/tests/test_dfw_hvac.py` for future runs
- Resolves 5 known Next.js 14 CVEs (DoS, request smuggling) and 23 npm vulnerabilities

### Session: April 17-18, 2026
- Address autocomplete verified working on all 5 form pages

## Prioritized Backlog

### High Priority
1. ~~Next.js upgrade (14→15+) + npm vulnerability fixes~~ ✅ **DONE Apr 19, 2026** (now on 15.5.9 + React 19)
2. Audit site for speed, SEO, and conversion
2a. **Deep technical SEO & architecture audit** ⭐ Added Apr 20, 2026 after discovering `/_next/` robots.txt bug. Systematic sweep for legacy anti-patterns: robots.txt/meta-robots consistency, HTTP headers, canonical tags, structured data (JSON-LD), OG/Twitter meta, internal linking, image optimization, 3rd-party scripts, 404/redirect coverage, mobile/a11y, HTML validation, security, supply-chain. Deliverable: `/app/frontend/internal/DFW_HVAC_Technical_Audit_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (3-5 hrs, quarterly cadence). Details in Action_Items.md item 2a.
2b. **Page-by-page ranking factor audit** ⭐ Added Apr 20, 2026 to address the meta-description-is-not-ranking-factor gap. Systematic matrix of ~47 pages × 10 ranking factors (title tag, body content depth, GBP, backlinks, Core Web Vitals/INP, NAP, internal linking, reviews, schema, meta desc). Sub-tasks P1.6a–f: title audit (highest leverage), body content depth, backlink profile, INP measurement, review cadence, schema verification. Deliverable: `/app/frontend/internal/DFW_HVAC_Ranking_Factor_Audit_YYYY-MM-DD.md`. ~10–15 hrs across sessions. Full context in NEXT_SESSION_PRIORITIES.md § P1.6.
3. ~~Google Search Console setup~~ ✅ **MOSTLY DONE** (verified Apr 20, 2026 — Domain property, GA4 linked, crawling active)
3a. **Post-migration GSC health check** — Site launched Apr 16, 2026. Submit sitemap, verify all 47 URLs index within 4 weeks, watch for 404s on old Wix URLs, use URL Inspection to request indexing on top ~10 pages. Capture baseline Performance numbers. Wait until ~May 14 for clean 28-day "new vs old" comparison. Details in Action_Items.md item 3a.
4. Pre-launch verification (mobile, cross-browser, broken links)
5. Internal linking audit

### P2 — Important
6. Custom Meta Descriptions — 7 Service Pages & 28 City Pages
7. "50+ cities" claim cleanup
8. Google Business Profile setup
9. Local citations (Yelp, BBB, Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack)
10. Production caching mode (webhook revalidation)
11. Code cleanup (unused dependencies, Sanity production mode)
12. Google Tag Manager setup
13. Facebook Pixel setup
14. GA4 conversion event setup (form submissions, click-to-call)
15. **Next.js 15 → 16 upgrade (+ Sanity 3.50+)** — Revisit ~summer 2026 once Next 16.3+ ships with more bake time. Bundle with Sanity upgrade to clear React 19 peer-dep warnings. Expected effort: 30–60 min (async params already done, no middleware, no parallel routes). Trigger earlier if 15.x CVE isn't backported or we need 16-only features (Cache Components, View Transitions).
16. **TBT optimization — lazy-load 3rd-party scripts** — Reduce TBT from ~2,300ms → ~400ms and Perf score 69 → 85+ by lazy-loading Google Maps (on form focus), reCAPTCHA (lazyOnload), GA4 (afterInteractive), and RealWork widget (IntersectionObserver). ~3 hrs. UX-only win (LCP + CLS already passing, so no SEO impact). Details in Action_Items.md item 13b.

### P3 — Backlog
15. AI Readiness / AEO
16. Expand City Page Content (300-500 words per city)
17. Content Hub / Resources Section
18. Content creation (case studies, financing page)
19. YouTube video embed (IAQ page)
20. Housecall Pro Direct API Integration
21. RealWork subscription evaluation
22. Latent Sanity data bug (graceful null handling)
23. Cancel Wix subscription

### Recurring
24. Analyze fallback / seed data for inaccuracies — Annual
