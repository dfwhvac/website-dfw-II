**Location:** `/app/frontend/app/faq/page.jsx` or Sanity CMS FAQ content
**Action:** Change the answer to a one-sentence summary + link to `/cities-served`
**Target answer:** "We proudly serve the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, including Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington, Plano, Irving, Frisco, and surrounding communities. [View all cities we serve →](/cities-served)"

**Context:** Part of ensuring service area references are consistent and link to the authoritative Cities Served page.

## Deployment Info

**Vercel Deploy Hook:** `https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/prj_yTjUnxmwjCsoARCD3EYvzPeK3ubf/RuXmoGHl40`
- Trigger manually: `curl -X POST "<hook-url>"`
- Auto-deploys should trigger on GitHub push to connected branch

## Original Problem Statement
Build a premium, conversion-focused website for DFW HVAC company using Next.js frontend and Sanity.io for content management. The site follows a **phone-first conversion strategy** — funneling users to call the business directly or submit a lead form for a callback. The Housecall Pro booking integration was intentionally removed due to operational constraints.

## User Personas
- **Business Owner**: Needs strategic data to optimize service delivery and marketing
- **Potential Customers**: Looking for HVAC services in the DFW area
- **Marketing Team**: Requires data-driven insights for targeting campaigns

## Core Conversion Strategy
**Phone-First, Form-Second**
1. **Primary CTA**: "Call Now" (click-to-call)
2. **Secondary CTA**: "Request Service" (leads to contact form)
3. **Tertiary CTA**: Subtle link to `/estimate` for replacement quotes

## Core Requirements
1. Dynamic website with Sanity CMS for all content
2. Lead capture with email notifications
3. SEO-optimized pages with structured data
4. Service area definition with drive-time analysis
5. Phone-first conversion optimization

## Site Launch Transition Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch Preparation
- [ ] Complete all development tasks (see Pending Tasks below)
- [ ] Set up Google Search Console and verify domain ownership
- [ ] Final testing on preview environment
- [ ] Create backup/export of current Wix site content (if needed)

### Phase 2: DNS Transition (Go-Live Day)

**Option A: Use Vercel Nameservers (Recommended - Simplest)**
1. Log into **GoDaddy** → My Products → dfwhvac.com → DNS → Nameservers
2. Change from Wix nameservers to Vercel nameservers:
   - `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
   - `ns2.vercel-dns.com`
3. In Vercel dashboard: Add `dfwhvac.com` as production domain
4. Wait for DNS propagation (15 min - 48 hours)

**Option B: Keep GoDaddy DNS (More Control)**
1. Log into **GoDaddy** → My Products → dfwhvac.com → DNS → Nameservers
2. Change to GoDaddy nameservers (if not already)
3. Add DNS records pointing to Vercel:
   - `A` record: `@` → `76.76.21.21`
   - `CNAME` record: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
4. In Vercel dashboard: Add `dfwhvac.com` as production domain
5. Wait for DNS propagation

### Phase 3: Post-Launch Verification
- [ ] Verify site loads at `https://dfwhvac.com`
- [ ] Verify `www.dfwhvac.com` redirects properly
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is active (automatic with Vercel)
- [ ] Test all forms, CTAs, and phone links
- [ ] Verify RealWork widget loads correctly
- [ ] Submit updated sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Monitor for 404 errors (implement 301 redirects as needed)

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Cancel Wix subscription (after confirming new site is stable)
- [ ] Update any external listings with new site info (if URLs changed)

## Pending Tasks

> **See `/app/frontend/PROJECT_TASKS.md` for the complete, authoritative checklist.**

### P0 - Critical
- [x] **Lead Capture Form Backend** - ✅ Implemented with MongoDB storage. Email notifications configured via Resend (pending domain verification).
- [ ] **Resend Domain Verification** - Verify `dfwhvac.com` in Resend to enable email notifications. **⚠️ BLOCKED:** Wix DNS doesn't support required records. Will be unblocked when DNS moves to Vercel at go-live. **This is the launch plan for lead notifications.**
- [ ] **301 Redirects** - Identify and configure redirects for old URLs before launch

### P1 - Important (Pre-Launch)
- [ ] **Google Search Console Setup & Verification** - Verify domain via GoDaddy DNS TXT record; check indexing status
- [x] **RealWork Widget SEO Evaluation** - ✅ CONFIRMED: Widget has **ZERO SEO value** (Google does not index the content). Value is purely visual trust for on-page visitors.
- [ ] **RealWork Subscription Cost Evaluation** - User to evaluate whether the subscription cost is justified by its trust/conversion value alone (not SEO)
- [x] **SEO Implementation** - ✅ sitemap.xml, robots.txt created; canonical URLs fixed across all pages (Feb 23, 2025)
- [ ] **Create OG Image** - Replace the placeholder logo with a proper Open Graph image. See instructions below.
- [ ] **YouTube Video Embed** - Indoor Air Quality page
- [ ] **Content Creation** - Case studies, financing pages
- [ ] **Internal Linking** - Cross-link services ↔ cities
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Lighthouse audit
- [ ] **Pre-Launch Verification** - Mobile/browser testing, forms, broken links
- [ ] **DNS Transition Planning** - Decide between Vercel nameservers vs. GoDaddy DNS approach

#### OG Image Instructions
The Open Graph (OG) image is displayed when your site is shared on social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, iMessage, etc.).

**Current state:** Using company logo as placeholder at `/app/frontend/public/images/dfwhvac-og.jpg`

**To create a proper OG image:**
1. **Size:** 1200 x 630 pixels (required aspect ratio for social media)
2. **Content suggestions:**
   - Company logo prominently displayed
   - Tagline: "Trust. Excellence. Care." or "Three Generations of Trusted Service"
   - Professional HVAC imagery (AC unit, service truck, or happy homeowner)
   - Dallas-Fort Worth reference (subtle skyline or "Serving DFW" text)
   - Brand colors: Navy (#003153), Cyan (#00B8FF), Red (#FF0000)
3. **Format:** JPG or PNG
4. **File location:** Save as `/app/frontend/public/images/dfwhvac-og.jpg`
5. **Keep text minimal** - social platforms overlay their own title/description

### P2 - Launch Day
- [ ] **DNS Cutover** - Change nameservers in GoDaddy from Wix to Vercel (or update A/CNAME records)
- [ ] **Domain Configuration in Vercel** - Add dfwhvac.com as production domain
- [ ] **SSL Verification** - Confirm HTTPS working on new domain
- [ ] **Post-Launch Testing** - Verify all pages, forms, RealWork widget, redirects

### P3 - Post-Launch
- [ ] Production Caching Mode (webhook revalidation)
- [ ] Marketing & Analytics (GA4, GTM, Facebook Pixel)
- [ ] Google Business Profile setup
- [ ] Local Citations (Yelp, BBB, Angi, etc.)
- [ ] City Page SEO Enhancement (300-500 word descriptions)
- [ ] City + Service Combination Pages (e.g., `/dallas-ac-repair/`)
- [ ] Feature Enhancements (clean URLs, seasonal strategy, etc.)
- [ ] Code Cleanup (remove mockData.js, unused deps)
- [ ] Cancel Wix Subscription (after confirming stability)
- [ ] **Housecall Pro Direct Integration** - See details below
- [ ] **"50+ Cities" Claim Cleanup** - See details below

#### Housecall Pro API Integration (Post-Launch)
**Goal:** Automatically create customers/jobs in Housecall Pro when leads submit the Request Service form.

**Current launch plan:** Email notifications via Resend (manual entry into HCP)

**Future integration approach:** Direct API integration (no Zapier fees, instant, reliable)

**Questions to answer before implementation:**
1. Does HCP API support customer lookup by email/phone? (for deduplication)
2. Does it auto-deduplicate or do we need to handle that logic?
3. What fields are required to create a customer vs. a job?
4. What HCP subscription tier is needed for API access?
5. How to obtain API credentials?

**Proposed flow:**
```
Form submission
      ↓
Check if customer exists (by email OR phone)
      ↓
  ┌───┴───┐
  YES     NO
  ↓       ↓
Add job   Create new customer + job
      ↓
MongoDB backup (audit trail)
      ↓
Success response to user
```

**Benefits over Zapier:**
- No monthly fee ($240-600/yr saved)
- Instant (vs 1-15 min delay)
- More reliable (no middleman)
- Complete data mapping control

#### "50+ Cities" Claim Cleanup (Post-Launch)
**Issue:** The site references "50+ cities" in several places, but Sanity only has 28 cities configured.

**Files to update:**
1. `/app/frontend/app/recent-projects/page.jsx` - Meta description and page content
2. `/app/frontend/scripts/seed-brand-content.js` - Seed data references
3. `/app/frontend/components/HomePage.jsx` - Stats section
4. `/app/frontend/components/CompanyPageTemplate.jsx` - Stats section
5. `/app/frontend/components/AboutPageTemplate.jsx` - Stats references

**Resolution options:**
1. **Update copy to accurate language:** "We serve the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex" (no specific number)
2. **Add more cities to Sanity:** Expand coverage to actually serve 50+ cities

**Recommendation:** Use option 1 (accurate language) unless business expansion warrants adding more city pages.
