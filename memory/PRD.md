# DFW HVAC Website - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a premium, conversion-focused website for DFW HVAC company using Next.js frontend and Sanity.io for content management. The site follows a **phone-first conversion strategy** — funneling users to call the business directly or submit a lead form for a callback. The Housecall Pro booking integration was intentionally removed due to operational constraints.

## User Personas
- **Business Owner**: Needs strategic data to optimize service delivery and marketing
- **Potential Customers**: Looking for HVAC services in the DFW area
- **Marketing Team**: Requires data-driven insights for targeting campaigns

## Core Conversion Strategy
**Phone-First, Form-Second**
1. **Primary CTA**: "Call Now" (click-to-call)
2. **Secondary CTA**: "Request Service" (leads to contact form)
3. **Tertiary CTA**: Subtle link to `/estimate` for replacement quotes

## Core Requirements
1. Dynamic website with Sanity CMS for all content
2. Lead capture with email notifications
3. SEO-optimized pages with structured data
4. Service area definition with drive-time analysis
5. Phone-first conversion optimization

## Site Launch Transition Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch Preparation
- [ ] Complete all development tasks (see Pending Tasks below)
- [ ] Set up Google Search Console and verify domain ownership
- [ ] Final testing on preview environment
- [ ] Create backup/export of current Wix site content (if needed)

### Phase 2: DNS Transition (Go-Live Day)

**Option A: Use Vercel Nameservers (Recommended - Simplest)**
1. Log into **GoDaddy** → My Products → dfwhvac.com → DNS → Nameservers
2. Change from Wix nameservers to Vercel nameservers:
   - `ns1.vercel-dns.com`
   - `ns2.vercel-dns.com`
3. In Vercel dashboard: Add `dfwhvac.com` as production domain
4. Wait for DNS propagation (15 min - 48 hours)

**Option B: Keep GoDaddy DNS (More Control)**
1. Log into **GoDaddy** → My Products → dfwhvac.com → DNS → Nameservers
2. Change to GoDaddy nameservers (if not already)
3. Add DNS records pointing to Vercel:
   - `A` record: `@` → `76.76.21.21`
   - `CNAME` record: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
4. In Vercel dashboard: Add `dfwhvac.com` as production domain
5. Wait for DNS propagation

### Phase 3: Post-Launch Verification
- [ ] Verify site loads at `https://dfwhvac.com`
- [ ] Verify `www.dfwhvac.com` redirects properly
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is active (automatic with Vercel)
- [ ] Test all forms, CTAs, and phone links
- [ ] Verify RealWork widget loads correctly
- [ ] Submit updated sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Monitor for 404 errors (implement 301 redirects as needed)

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Cancel Wix subscription (after confirming new site is stable)
- [ ] Update any external listings with new site info (if URLs changed)
